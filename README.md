<H1>Terraform Scripts to Automate the Deployment of Cloudflare Access for a Private Application</H1>
<H2>Description</H2>
This set of terraform files and linux script automates the setup of Cloudflare Zero Trust Access Application, Cloudflare Tunnel, and Tunnel Route.  The outputs include the public URL to access the application, the tunnel id and the tokens which you will pass to the linux script that will be used to install a Cloudflare Tunnel instance or replica.  An example shell script to use on the target host is also provided. 

<H2>Prerequisites:</H2>
 - You must have an active Cloudflare Zone (domain)
 - Install Terraform (or use Terraform Cloud)
 - Set your Cloudflare API Token/API Key/Email Address as an environment variables

<H2>Configure Terraform:</H2>
 - Place all .tf files in a new directory.
 - Copy terraform.tfvars.example to terraform.tfvars.
 - Edit terraform.tfvars with your specific values (Account ID, Zone ID, hostname, etc.).
 - add *.tfvars to your .gitignore (or equivalent) if using version control

<H2>Apply Terraform:</H2>
 - Run terraform init to initialize the provider.
 - Run terraform apply to create the Cloudflare resources.
 - Review the plan and type yes when prompted.
 - After it completes, Terraform will output the tunnel_token. Copy this token.

<H2>Install Tunnel on Linux Host:</H2>
 - Copy the install_fips_tunnel.sh script to your Linux server (the one running your private web app).
 - Make the script executable: chmod +x install_fips_tunnel.sh.
 - Run the script with sudo, passing the token from the Terraform output:
 - Bash
   sudo ./install_tunnel.sh <PASTE_YOUR_TUNNEL_TOKEN_HERE>

<H2>Verify:</H2>
 - On your Linux host, check the service status: sudo systemctl status cloudflared.
 - In your Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard, check that your tunnel is "Healthy".
 - Open a browser and navigate to your app_hostname (e.g., https://secure-app.yourdomain.com). You should be prompted with the Cloudflare Access login screen.

<strong>Known Issues:</strong>
When generating a plan, you might receive a warning similar to:

Warning: Resource Destruction Considerations
with cloudflare_zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflared_config.app_config
on main.tf line 24, in resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflared_config" "app_config":
resource "cloudflare_zero_trust_tunnel_cloudflared_config" "app_config" {
This resource cannot be destroyed from Terraform. If you create this resource, it will be present in the API until manually deleted

This seems to be a false positive warning.  I was able to remove the created entities without issue by queuing a destroy plan.  The resource in question is related to a parent resource which is deleted sucessfully so it is destroyed by relation.
